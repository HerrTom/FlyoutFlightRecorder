# FlyoutFlightRecorder
A simple data recorder for Flyout. It's probably pretty janky and might do weird things since I don't really know what I'm doing, so buyer beware!

Requires MelonLoader.

# Installation
Extract into the Flyout steam folder. There should be `FlyoutFlightRecorder.dll` in the `./Plugins/` directory and `FlyoutFlightRecorder.cfg` in the `./UserData/` directory.  The plugin will also announce itself in the MelonLoader console.

# Usage
Default keybind is Numpad Asterisk, you can change it in the cfg file located in <flyout directory>/UserData. CSV files will also be saved there.  While recording, red `RECORDING` text will appear in the upper left corner of the screen to let you konw it's working.
